# Project Roadmap

Tracking ideas and tasks to work on or improve.

## Things to Work On

 * Include build instructions for mapper
 * More CLI commands run or operated using yad (yad - tool for creating graphical dialogs from shell scripts) <http://smokey01.com/yad/>
   * yad progress is not going well, found a possible better way using a `.desktop` file to run a `bash script` - still testing this
 * Include screenshots for the setup pages on how to install and manage VirtualBox
 * Documentation improvements for clarity and grammar corrections
 * VM export is in `Open Virtualization Format 1.0` - what else is that compatible with besides VirtualBox?
 * Improve markdown formatting and layout for existing documentation
 * Customized the interface or theme to be more Crossfire-like vs the purple and orange of Ubuntu?
 * Plan and document a release schedule

## Things to Maintain

 * VM OS patch updates and upgrades
 * Crossfire code updates
 * HOWTO documentation
